Question 1:
             A
             |
             B
             |
             C
             |
             D

    Four processes are created (including initial parent A). First, Process A
    completes the first fork() and creates child process B. A then immediately
    breaks out of the loop and prints the statement (fork() returns the pid of
    process B which evaluates to true). Process B runs (i == 1) and forks and
    breaks immediately since fork() returns a positive (C's pid), creating
    child process C. Process C runs (i == 2), forks and breaks immediately
    just like process C, creating process D. At this point, i == 3, so D does
    not run through the loop and simply prints the statement.

Question 2:
               A
        /   |    |    \
        B   C    D     E

    Five processes are created (including initial parent A). First, Process A
    completes the first fork() and creates child process B. Since fork()
    returns a positive value (B's pid). Process A goes through the loop again
    and forks until the loop ends with 4 iterations. This creates four
    children of A in total: B, C, D, and E. A then prints the statement and
    exits. When each child process goes through the loop, fork() returns 0,
    causing them to break the loop and print the statement without creating
    any child processes.

Question 3:
               A
           /   |   \
          B    C     D
       /  |    |
      E   F    G
      |
      H

      Eight processes are created (including initial parent A). First, Process
      A completes the first fork() and creates child process B. Since the fork
      was successful, both A and B complete the 2nd iteration and create child
      processes E (child of B) and C (child of A). The forks were successful,
      so processes A, B, C, and E complete the 3rd iteration of the loop, so
      they each fork and create child processes D, F, G, and H respectively.
      At this point, the loop ends and they print the printf statements.

Question 4:

      This distribution is called "normal distribution". I believe the
      histogram represents the normal distribution because the definition of
      a normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that represents the
      probability of many random variables. In the simple pinball process, I
      generated and graph many random variables, which is consistent with the
      definition of a normal curve. Additionally, the more balls that are
      dropped in the process (more random variables) the more the histogram
      represents a bell-shaped curve.
